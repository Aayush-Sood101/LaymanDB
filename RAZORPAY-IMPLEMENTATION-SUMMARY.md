# Razorpay Integration Implementation - Summary

I've implemented the complete Razorpay payment integration with Clerk authentication for LaymanDB. Here's a summary of the implementation:

## Files Created

### API Routes
1. `/api/payment/route.js` - Creates a Razorpay order for chosen plan
2. `/api/payment/verify/route.js` - Verifies payment and updates user metadata
3. `/api/user/status/route.js` - Fetches user's subscription status
4. `/api/schema-generation/route.js` - Handles usage tracking and limits

### Frontend Pages
1. `/subscribe/page.js` - Main subscription page with payment plans
2. `/billing/success/page.js` - Payment success page
3. `/billing/cancel/page.js` - Payment cancellation page

### Components
1. `SubscriptionStatus.js` - Displays user's current plan and usage
2. `PaywallNotice.js` - Shown when user has no trials/credits left

### Environment Configuration
1. `sample.env.local` - Sample environment variables file

## Clerk Integration

The system uses Clerk's privateMetadata to store:
- `freeTrialCount`: Number of free trials used (out of 10)
- `isPro`: Whether the user has paid
- `paidSchemaCredits`: Number of paid generations remaining
- `subscriptionPlan`: "Basic" or "Premium"
- `paymentHistory`: Record of past payments

## Subscription Flow

1. Every new user gets 10 free schema generations
2. After free trials are used, users are prompted to purchase:
   - Basic Plan: ₹30 for 100 schema generations
   - Premium Plan: ₹50 for 200 schema generations
3. The purchase process uses Razorpay's checkout system
4. After successful payment, the user's metadata is updated with new credits

## Usage Tracking

The system tracks usage through the `/api/schema-generation` endpoint:
- Checks if user has available credits or free trials
- Updates usage counters in Clerk metadata
- Prevents usage if limits are reached

## UI Integration

- Added subscription status display in the workspace
- Added subscription links in the navbar
- Added paywall notice when limits are reached
- Integrated the payment flow with success/cancel pages

## How to Complete Setup

1. Create a Razorpay account and get your API keys
2. Add the keys to your `.env.local` file based on the sample.env.local
3. You may need to complete KYC for live payments (test mode works without it)

## Testing

For testing in development mode:
1. Use Razorpay's test mode keys
2. Test cards are available in Razorpay's documentation
3. Webhook testing can be done with the Razorpay CLI for local development
